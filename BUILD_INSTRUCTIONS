Constant Propagation Analysis: sh runscripts/constantprop.sh $BENCHMARKS/{name of benchmark test}
Available Expression Analysis: sh runscripts/avail_expr.sh $BENCHMARKS/{name of benchmark test}
Range Analysis: sh runscripts/RangeAnalysis.sh $BENCHMARKS/{name of benchmark test}
May Pointer Analysis: sh runscripts/may-pointer.sh $BENCHMARKS/{name of benchmark test}
Must Pointer Analysis: sh runscripts/must-pointer.sh $BENCHMARKS/{name of benchmark test}

Results will be printed to stderr, or the console.
